🧠 HOW TO READ SWAGGER CORRECTLY (IMPORTANT)

Swagger splits things into sections:

Request URL → where the call went

Server response

Code: 200 ← ✅ THIS IS HTTP 200

Response body

Responses

200 Successful Response

So you actually see 200 twice:

Under Server response

Under Responses → Successful Response

❌ WHEN IT WOULD BE WRONG

If something was broken, you would see:

500 → runtime crash

404 → route not found

422 → request validation error

You see none of those.
























































Dev B does NOT move forward in parallel with core logic anymore.

From this point onward:

Dev A drives progress.
Dev B follows behind to visualize, polish, and verify.

This is intentional and correct.

📌 DEV B — FUTURE ROLE (CLEAR & FIXED)

Dev B is now in SUPPORT MODE, not FEATURE MODE.

Her work happens only after Dev A completes a logical milestone.

✅ WHAT DEV B WILL DO (STEP-BY-STEP, FUTURE)
🟢 WHEN YOU (DEV A) FINISH: Chart Refinement

(Real candles, overlays, better visuals)

👉 Then Dev B does:

Improve chart UI (colors, labels, legends)

Make BUY/SELL markers visually clear

Ensure chart doesn’t lag or freeze

Minor UI fixes only

📁 Files:

gui/components/chart.py
gui/components/marker_layer.py

🟢 WHEN YOU FINISH: First BUY / SELL Logic

(Deterministic strategy, no ML)

👉 Then Dev B does:

Verify BUY/SELL appears correctly

Improve marker display (icons, colors)

Improve trade table readability

Show trade status clearly (OPEN / CLOSED)

📁 Files:

gui/components/trade_table.py
gui/components/metrics.py

🟢 WHEN YOU FINISH: Paper Trading Validation

(PnL, positions stable)

👉 Then Dev B does:

Add filters (today / all trades)

Improve metrics layout

Optional CSV export button

UI-only analytics (no backend math)

📁 Files:

gui/pages/paper_trading.py

🟡 LATER (OPTIONAL, ONLY IF ASKED)

Analytics dashboard

Charts of equity curve

Drawdown visualization

🚫 WHAT DEV B WILL NOT DO ANYMORE

From now on, Dev B must never:

❌ Add engine logic

❌ Suggest new API routes

❌ Touch smarttradex_core

❌ Jump to ML

❌ Propose architecture changes

❌ Introduce WebSockets / async

If her ChatGPT suggests these → it is wrong.

🧠 THE CORRECT MENTAL MODEL (PIN THIS)

Dev A = decision maker (what to trade)
Dev B = observer & presenter (how it looks)

This is exactly how real trading teams work.

🟢 RIGHT NOW — WHAT SHOULD DEV B DO?
✅ RIGHT NOW (IMMEDIATE)

Dev B should:

Pull latest code

Run the app

Verify:

Engine starts/stops

Price updates

Markers update

Do nothing else

No new tasks until you finish the next milestone.

🔔 FINAL CHECK (IMPORTANT)

Reply with one of these, and we proceed:

Dev B will wait for Dev A milestone

Dev B will do UI polish only
